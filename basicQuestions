Just some basic interview questions you'll come across, and how to answer them.

> 1. Tell us about yourself.
Answer: Basically recap your resume. Keep the answer under a minute if you can, highlight your accomplishments. 
Why? - Not everyone's read your Linkedin or your cover letter. 

> 2. Why do you want this job?
Answer: Explain your personal goals. I always personally highlight my desire to continually learn and grow, and contribute meaningfully to an organization.
Why? - Shows you actually care about the job, which seems silly given that it's a job, but people like that you care. 

> 3. Why are manhole covers round?
Answer: It's cheaper to make than square covers.
Why? - These are one of those silly "Linkedin" questions that just shows your line of thiking. It's admittedly a bit of a red flag, but it's not the worst.

> 4. Tell us about one of your weaknesses/a time you failed.
Answer: Story time baby. Story answers are cheat codes for these sorts of questions, as you can showcase your growth without seeming like you're grandstanding. 
Tell a story about a time you failed at something, and was able to learn and grow from that failure. 
Why? - This is a way to provide self awareness and your ability to recognize your shortcomings. Everyone has shortcomings, whether you learn from them is another question entirely.

> 5. What would your boss say about you if we asked them?
Answer: Speak positively. If your boss had nothing positive to say about you (which is more a reflection on them than you), answer with whatever you were able to continue doing at your workplace.
Why? - This is a way to determine how you build your relationship with your immediate manager.
