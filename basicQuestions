Just some basic interview questions you'll come across, and how to answer them.

> 1. Tell us about yourself.
Answer: Basically recap your resume. Keep the answer under a minute if you can, highlight your accomplishments. 
Why? - Not everyone's read your Linkedin or your cover letter. 

> 2. Why do you want this job?
Answer: Explain your personal goals. I always personally highlight my desire to continually learn and grow, and contribute meaningfully to an organization.
Why? - Shows you actually care about the job, which seems silly given that it's a job, but people like that you care. 

> 3. Why are manhole covers round?
Answer: It's cheaper to make than square covers.
Why? - These are one of those silly "Linkedin" questions that just shows your line of thiking. It's admittedly a bit of a red flag, but it's not the worst.
