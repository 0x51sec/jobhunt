GENERALLY AVOID ANSWERING THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS IN INTERVIEWS, AS THEY ARE EITHER ILLEGAL OR CAN BE USED TO DISCRIMINATE AGAINST YOU:

  - What are your salary expectations?
  - What is your current compensation?
  
> Personal identity and information (Can be used for discrimination. If applicable, this information should have already been answered within the application. This may be operatively different than asking for pronouns, however)

> Membership of clubs or organizations (This is often used as a proxy question to determine race, sex, gender identity, religion, familial status, financial status, or other personal information that is irrelevant to the job)
